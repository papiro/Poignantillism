Sunlight drenching, drip-dropping off of every surface rendering all to be beautiful. That was the sentiment I got as I fixed my eyes on a trash-can, about 10 meters away, plastic cup in-hand. I was doing my duty as an upright citizen of my immediate environment, the cup was half-full, placed carefully out of the way in the corner of where the stone street met a building in an open-aired alleyway. The cup of my soul was half-full at this point in my life, and I was searching for the other half and had not yet realized it. It would be months before I would realize it, knowing only that I wanted a great responsibility which my juvenile habits were not yet ready to endure.

My eyes fixed upon the trash-can, I made my way towards my singular purpose of cleaning up the world around me and, as I came within a few feet of the trash-can, my will began to assert itself upon the contents of the trash, truly imbibing of the proverb "one man's trash is another man's treasure", loosely hoping to find some article of use amongst the top layer of refuse. I placed the cup down into the can and with one-and-the-same motion whirled the bottom of the cup around that top layer just to see what treasures may have been poorly hidden. My wife makes the reasonable claim that I was "digging in the trash." But only lightly digging! 

I was houseless - not homeless, although I tell most folks I was homeless, because I've forgotten the difference. I had a shirt once which said "My home is in my head" - which was the attitude I kept during my journeyings in the wilderness of these urban areas of the United States.

My wife had prayed for an angel and I, I prayed for direction.
